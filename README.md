ARES- The Assistive Rehabilitation ExoSkeleton

ABSTRACT

Rehabilitation of patients who have recovered from a stroke is a tedious and difficult process, involving a very long recovery time for the patient. Therapists guide patients to do a series of exercises or tasks, for short but intensive sessions. Passive exoskeletons are often used to keep track of the patientâ€™s progress digitally, along with therapist supervision. In any case, it is an expensive and slow process, since the sessions are very short, and trained manpower is required. This repository contains the codes for control of an active upper limb exoskeleton to address these issues. The exoskeleton is controlled using the EMG signals from the muscle groups involved in the motion, and provides physical assistance to the desired motion. Patients with very limited ability can use preset functions in the exoskeleton, and once they have gained enough muscle strength, they can begin to use the EMG based control. Wearing it over the entire course of the day can perform a dual function of assisting them in their day to day tasks, and performing therapy at the same time.

This repository contains the codebase for ARESv2. Link to documentation will be provided soon.
